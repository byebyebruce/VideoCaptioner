1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Hey friends, what's up?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,960
If you aren't aware recently the Svel hack 2024 rules edition has ended.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,440
And basically if you're one of the lucky participants in the Svel hackathon, maybe you enjoy some

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,120
of these big money prizes so we can see you could've earned up to $3000 for the first

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,920
place which is really awesome just for writing some Svelte.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,080
And we can even look at some winners from previous years, so 2023 halftime flies right?

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,120
Someone actually made Wolfenstein in the browser, so they basically made Wolfen Svelte which

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,820
is a fully playable port of Wolfenstein 3D, 100% rendered by Svelte.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,520
So no WebGL or Canvas, it just uses CSS and transforms things around and it just slaps

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,940
things in the browser which is really incredible.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,560
Then you also had some awesome and amazing projects which a lot of people love, like

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,120
Superforms for example.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,200
And then you had some other amazing projects like SvelteLab which is basically a repl for

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,240
SvelteKit projects so you can easily spin up Svelte or SvelteKit projects and try things

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,200
out without much fuss, right?

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,240
But today we're going to be looking at the previous year of our Lord, 2024, it's already

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,740
2025, so we're going to look at some cool apps from a cross-platform app launcher like

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,080
Krakas to some fun games made with Svelte.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,200
Alright, so the first category is going to be WizBangery.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
And what is WizBangery?

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,560
Well basically the wizards of WizBangery are masters of innovation, showcasing novel and

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,420
impressive uses of Svelte.

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,080
Basically you make something cool and then you get paid.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,380
And the first place is going to be KunKun.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,380
And what is KunKun?

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,480
KunKun is an open source extensible cross-platform app launcher.

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,560
Basically it's like Krakas but for every other platform, right?

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
So it's cross-platform extensible with a focus on privacy.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,040
So let's actually look at how it looks like.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,320
So you can launch KunKun and of course you can search for applications, maybe there's

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,160
even an extension for searching for files and you have these built-in commands, right,

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,400
which are really useful and you have system-wide commands like cleaning the trash and etc.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,320
And you can of course go to the store, you can install any of these extensions or you

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,560
can create your own extension.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
How cool is this?

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,900
And there's a lot of cool tech behind KunKun.

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,100
So basically it uses Tori.

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,560
If you're familiar with Electron, Tori is like Electron.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,840
By the way, writing pure JavaScript is basically Rust first, but then you can use any front-end

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,220
framework JavaScript that is that you want.

41
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,840
You can use Svelte, React and etc.

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,640
And that's how you can easily build cross-platform applications and in the future even mobile

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
apps, I think.

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,680
And the major difference between Tori and Electron is that Electron ships the entire

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,200
Chrome browser or whatever, but Tori on the other hand uses the built-in web views in

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,380
your operating system.

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,320
So your operating system, Windows, Mac, OS, Linux, etc. have a built-in browser that comes

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,280
with it, right, so it uses that instead.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,000
That's basically how I understand it.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,360
But because Tori is so new, it doesn't really have that entire ecosystem that Electron does.

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,680
And keep in mind Tori isn't this Electron killer that people pretend it is because you're

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,520
going to have to write Rust and etc., which is of course the blazing fast language.

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,040
So if you're into that, then you can use Tori.

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,400
And of course, it uses Svelte for the UI and Tailwind, CSS for the styling, but in particular

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,120
it uses Shad C and Svelte.

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
That's why it looks so good.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,160
And you can of course learn more about KunKun if you go to their docs.

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,480
Here you have get started, how to install it.

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,760
You can go through the demo, here they showcase a lot of these extensions that you have.

60
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,560
So you can just go to the store, you can install the extension, you can have clipboard history,

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
disk speed, file transfer, video converter and etc.

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,560
There's nothing you can do, right?

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,000
You can even write it yourself.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And it has also a huge emphasis on security because you know JavaScript, NPM, Ecosystem,

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,640
you install a package and boom, now you have a Cryptominer.

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Haha, pun.

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,080
Okay, but seriously, it actually tries its best and it's really new so you can even

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,640
join, hop in, help the development, right?

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,480
And it's not just Svelte if you want to write an extension, so let me just actually

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
find this section.

71
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,840
Basically, KunKun supports turning any static website into an extension.

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,920
So you can use any framework like React, Svelte and Vue.

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,320
You can use your own styles, but of course they recommend for consistency that you use

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,640
Tailwind CSS plus Shadsean.

75
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,040
And KunKun is a really cool project in my book.

76
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,480
Alright, so the second place goes to Infinite Turtles, which is a really simple but addictive

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
fun card game.

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,720
It's built with Frelth and you're going to see these beautiful animations using shaders.

79
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
So this is how it works.

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,520
This is basically your avatar, you have your enemy, it gets two attacks per turn.

81
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,320
You basically have to use turtles to sacrifice them so it doesn't hit you or bonk you on

82
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
the head, right?

83
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,360
So you can actually just place one of our turtles down here.

84
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,520
So it's going to attack this turtle and then it's going to attack us.

85
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,880
And you can of course heal yourself if you want, you can give yourself HP.

86
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,760
And now you're going to see we lose this turtle and we basically have to defend our turtles.

87
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,640
So we can put this turtle down here and now we can use this special rune, this state rune,

88
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,040
so we can actually prevent it from getting hit two times.

89
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,240
You can already see it soaked one HP.

90
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,480
Now it's going to retaliate and attack the enemy.

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,220
You can see how this simple game can end up being so much fun.

92
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,680
Now we can place this turtle, let's also protect this because why not?

93
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,760
You can see now it's going to attack it and we're going to retaliate and we're going to

94
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,240
destroy this guy.

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Later.

96
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Okay, great.

97
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,400
You can already see how fun and addicting this game is.

98
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,560
Now we get a new card, the In Spectrum, and you can see how much fun this is.

99
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,040
And of course, as I said, this uses Svelte under the hood.

100
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,360
You can see how cool this looks, right?

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,320
And I made a couple of videos about Svelte but I should make a new one because they recently

102
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
had a major version release, right?

103
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
So maybe you can check that out if you want.

104
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,160
Alright, so coming in third place is going to be Sudoku.

105
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,540
As the name says, it's basically Sudoku in Svelte and I honestly barely even know how

106
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Sudoku even works.

107
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,640
I only learned it for this game to understand how it works.

108
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,120
Basically when you play Sudoku, you have to place these numbers one through nine.

109
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,320
It has to go here horizontally for each line then vertically and then all of these special

110
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,560
blocks inside of here also have to have numbers from one to nine.

111
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,120
So basically you can just play this.

112
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,280
It's going to tell you, hey, you can't use one here, use something else, right?

113
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,800
In most other Sudoku games, I think if you do something like this, if you give enough

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,300
tries you're going to lose the game, right?

115
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,880
But in this case, it just lets you on easy mode, I guess, right?

116
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,920
So you can actually just place whatever you want in this case nine.

117
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,760
And then I even don't know what this game of this.

118
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,040
You have this classic version of Sudoku and you have this killer version which looks even

119
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,520
more insane to me as a person that doesn't even understand how Sudoku works in the first

120
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
place.

121
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,000
But if this is something for you, you can actually see a lot of love and care has been

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,240
put into this game.

123
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,680
So check out Sudoku.

124
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,200
And it's built with Tailwind CSS.

125
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,080
And for the UI, it uses Beats UI which had a new stable 1.0 release recently.

126
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,800
It also uses Shadzie and Svelte.

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,840
And for the icons, it uses Lucid which is one of my favorite icon packs.

128
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,160
And in fourth place, we have another fun game called Svelte Space, which is basically a

129
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,460
tower defense game.

130
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,840
So we can actually load this game up here, we can start a game, you can see these enemies

131
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,440
are going to spawn and we can just click on them to destroy them.

132
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,800
We can upgrade our towers right here if you have the resources, right?

133
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,640
So this is the basically the entire point behind killing these monsters.

134
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,760
And the lovely thing about this, all of these resources are handcrafted by a human, that's

135
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,160
right, not AI.

136
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,480
So how wonderful is this, right?

137
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,400
So if you have enough money, you can upgrade one of these towers.

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
And they basically have a couple of tiers that you can upgrade.

139
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,120
So over time, it becomes automatically, you just need to prevent these guys from hurting

140
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
your health bar.

141
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,440
Oh, you also lose money if you're bad at the game like me.

142
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,360
But yeah, basically that's how this works, right?

143
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,320
It's a really fun and simple game.

144
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,160
So let's actually look at another fun game, which is Haunted House.

145
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,480
And this is basically inspired by Dr. Mario, I believe.

146
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,800
It wasn't really said in the description, but I basically think that this is it, right?

147
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,020
And all these games also have a wonderful soundtrack, but to be safe, I muted the sound

148
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
for this video.

149
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,040
And of course you have guides, but to be honest, when I play games, I never read the guide.

150
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,360
I just want to play it.

151
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
And that's basically it, right?

152
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,600
So you can actually see your goal here.

153
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,840
When you enter the spooky house, you actually have these things like pills, right?

154
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,160
So Dr. Mario, right?

155
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,320
And then you have to get rid of these ghosts, so you have to put down in the same colors,

156
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
right?

157
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,640
Yeah, I'm already starting to be distracted, right?

158
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,360
When I look at this, some people are probably cringing super hard at this.

159
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,440
But basically if you have enough of the same colors, then you can actually slap these ghosts

160
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,760
and then you have some other special attacks, right?

161
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
That you can use.

162
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,440
So let me actually just do this.

163
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Okay.

164
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720
Oh, space bar just presses pause.

165
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,960
I thought that would immediately like Tetris, put this thing down.

166
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,520
So basically let me just, oops, I didn't mean to do that.

167
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Let me just do this.

168
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Okay, can I win?

169
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Oh no.

170
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,280
Okay, let me just go and do this.

171
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
And there you go.

172
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Now we got him.

173
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,920
And you can use special equipment like let me just use C. So next turn, let me just,

174
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
oh, okay.

175
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
It doesn't drop.

176
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
I always forget.

177
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,320
Because you can drop this and then it's going to clear this area if you want.

178
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,420
Or yeah, it's going to give you every color of this kind.

179
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,240
And then if we press X, oh, what is it?

180
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Okay.

181
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
It's V I think.

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Okay, so now we're going to get Le Bombe.

183
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,200
So now we can drop the bomb here to help you out.

184
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,960
And then we're going to clear this.

185
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,200
And boom, job well done because I'm that good at games.

186
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,640
Rogue Gamer, MLG, let's go.

187
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,440
It is what it is, right?

188
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,240
And basically this uses Svel Kidd.

189
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,920
It uses Tailwind CSS for the styles, of course.

190
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,480
Everyone uses Tailwind today.

191
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,680
And basically that's it for the Wiz Binary category.

192
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,440
Alright, so the next category is going to be Rune Ritualist.

193
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
And basically the requirement for this category is that you use Svel 5 runes to make something

194
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
cool.

195
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,520
As it says with the release of Svel 5, the Rune Ritualist can take full advantage of

196
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,600
runes and the capabilities they unlock.

197
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,420
So this category is for packages that push the envelope to the cutting edge.

198
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,280
So let's look at the first place, which is Synchro State.

199
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,280
So Synchro State is a package that brings Svelte reactivity to the multiplayer level.

200
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,800
And for this, it uses this Yjs package.

201
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,240
And then Synchro State provides a reactive and type safe API on top of it using Svelte.

202
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,760
So if you want to build something like Google Docs, Figma, and etc, this is what you want

203
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
to use.

204
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,300
And we're actually going to see in a second, once I enter this world, I haven't heard so

205
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,760
much word sell it in a while and of course I'm talking about this package.

206
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,160
I'm talking about things like this Yjs because immediately you read "Industry leading CRDT

207
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,040
for conflict free real time collaboration".

208
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,960
I'm like, all right, can I make something with it?

209
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
What is this?

210
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Right?

211
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
But basically you can just make real time applications and you're going to see some

212
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,720
funny marketing memes in a second when we look at LiveBlocks.

213
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
So let me actually show you this.

214
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,360
So usage, you basically can import a provider like LiveBlocks.

215
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,860
So this basically provides you with Yjs if you don't want to host it yourself, you basically

216
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,000
just do this, you can create a token, they have a free tier, right?

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,040
And then you just use this simple Synchro State API, you create this document here,

218
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,260
here you have this nodes array and then when you have this button here on click, you can

219
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,600
just mute the state, you can say document.nodes.push and you can update this.

220
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,360
Here they even have an example how this works.

221
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,920
So here is a live demo.

222
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,640
If you have another tab open, so this is really multiplayer, we can actually drag these objects

223
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
around and it would reflect in another person's tab, right?

224
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,440
So this is really wonderful if we move this circle around.

225
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,600
And it uses Yjs which are modular building blocks for building collaborative applications

226
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
like Google Docs and Figma.

227
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,320
And as you can see, it uses in this example LiveBlocks as a provider, but it's not really

228
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
necessary.

229
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,880
You can use anything that supports Yjs, but this is the funny part to me.

230
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,440
So let's look at their marketing.

231
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,040
Ready-made features for AI and human collaboration.

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,400
Like who is this marketer that someone explained me in the comments, right?

233
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,480
And here is the actually great part, it uses this awesome library, daisyui for the UI.

234
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,000
So I'm sure a lot of people already know about daisyui.

235
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,720
It is a really great package if you're working on any multiplayer experience.

236
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,320
Alright, so at the second place, we have to to slash svelte.

237
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,560
And basically to slash is a library that makes it really simple to add annotations when you're

238
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,040
using TypeScript in these code blocks.

239
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,880
So you can have these rich descriptions on your site.

240
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,420
So let's say for example, a svelte or svelte documentation would really benefit from something

241
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,080
like this, so you can hover over something in your code.

242
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,460
And then you can use Shiki to slash to show these TypeScript definitions or whatever else

243
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,460
you want.

244
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,400
So that is really awesome in my opinion.

245
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,480
Alright, coming hot in the third place is svizx or I don't know how you pronounce it

246
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
exactly.

247
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Basically, it's a port of this Airbnb vizx library, which is a collection of expressive

248
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,280
low level visualization primitives for react.

249
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,000
But in this case, svizx is for svelte, of course.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,080
So you can actually look at these components here.

251
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,520
If we just go here and we can start by looking at areas, we can look at axis, bar group,

252
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,300
whatever you need, you can use these components yourself.

253
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,800
They look really cool in my opinion.

254
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,520
So now it's really easy to use them also in svelte if this is something that you needed.

255
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,840
Yeah, look at this cool heat maps.

256
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Yeah, sure.

257
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,320
Give it to me.

258
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
Alright, awesome.

259
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
We have pies.

260
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,240
Everyone loves pies, right?

261
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,520
Polygons, radar, and the list goes on and on.

262
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,000
And of course, this uses d3, the bespoke JavaScript library for data visualization.

263
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,640
You can see you can do a lot with this.

264
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,360
Then at fourth place, we have svelte value inspect.

265
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,200
And this is really cool if you want to display your values, promises, and etc. as a JSON looking

266
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,760
tree thing.

267
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,640
You can actually just instantiate this and now you can pass in reactive values or whatever

268
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,600
and you're going to get this JSON like data looking structure so you can observe your

269
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
values changing in real time.

270
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,160
So you can actually look at some examples here and you can see in these examples, everything

271
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,000
works from strings and etc. to objects, date, and whatever else you might be needing.

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,240
So we have this expandable view, map and set even works.

273
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,360
We have promises.

274
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,880
So when you have code like this, you're going to see on the right side is going to show

275
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,920
you if the promise is resolved or not.

276
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
And this is a really cool looking library.

277
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,800
But yeah, of course, you can explore this yourself or let me know if you want a video on it.

278
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,120
Alright and coming in hot in the fifth place is FlexiBoards.

279
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,360
This is basically a cool headless reactive drag and drop component library for Svelte5.

280
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,600
So you can actually look at these examples here.

281
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,720
Alright so let's say for example that we want sales to take one spot here instead of taking

282
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,180
up the entire width and let's say that we want to move active in the second row.

283
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,400
So boom, bam, thank you ma'am.

284
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Now we're done.

285
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,840
We can actually exit edit mode and now we can change it anymore.

286
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,080
So basically if you need something flexible like this where the user can drag and drop

287
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,280
things around, this is the library that you're looking for.

288
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,520
And I believe that this concludes the winners in the Rune Ritualists category.

289
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,200
Alright in the last category we have the Migration Magician.

290
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Basically Migration Magicians are masters of transformation, showcasing impressive upgrades

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,960
of existing Svelte4 code to Svelte5.

292
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,320
So basically most of these projects are existing Svelte4 projects that were converted to Svelte5.

293
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,920
In the first place we have SvelteMapLibreGL or if you want to be more dramatic you can

294
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,060
say MapLibre.

295
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,680
But yeah basically we have here MapLibre.

296
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,600
Ok so this is basically a Svelte5 wrapper for MapLibreGL.js.

297
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,560
So you can use it to build interactive web maps effortlessly with Svelte's reactive and

298
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,820
declarative power.

299
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,800
So for example if we look at these examples here, you can look at the plain map for example.

300
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,440
So now we can learn some geography.

301
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,040
Ok here we have Japan, Land of the Rising Sun.

302
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,600
Ok so here we have these two Koreas and here is China.

303
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,220
Ok so here we can go to a more complex map.

304
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,880
We can actually, oh this is fancy right?

305
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Oh look at this.

306
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,640
We have markers and popups.

307
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Here we have this dog.

308
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,900
Very nice right?

309
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,680
So we can change the base styles apparently.

310
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Oh this looks really cool.

311
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Oh look at this.

312
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
Wow damn I might be a map person after all.

313
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Call me Johnny Harris.

314
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,000
Alright so here we can even have hover styles for this map.

315
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
United States.

316
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,440
Oh is this the 52nd state right here Canada?

317
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm just joking.

318
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,400
Ok so we can just go to the clusters and we can also look at some artings.

319
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Ok here it is.

320
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,320
So you can be the weather channel like this.

321
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,280
So you can have some images, you can animate them.

322
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,680
You can do whatever you want.

323
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,560
But basically this is a really cool library.

324
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,160
So let's actually see what it uses.

325
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
This is what I found out.

326
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,560
So it uses map Libre, GLJS for the maps right?

327
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:25,200
It uses this DecGL library for high power GPU performance large scale data visualization.

328
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,340
So you can see how they have this 3D representation here.

329
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,600
You can also do that using this package right?

330
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,560
So you can have a 3D representation of some map right?

331
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,340
And it uses PMTiles.

332
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,760
So this is some format for displaying maps.

333
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,920
I'm not really sure what it is but this is used for this library.

334
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,260
And then you have TerraDraw.

335
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,640
This is also some helpers for drawing maps right?

336
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,320
And basically this is really cool to me because we're seeing how this library stands on the

337
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,320
shoulder of giants because this would be really not feasible to do all of this yourself.

338
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,480
But now we have this beautiful API that we can use in Svelte without thinking about what

339
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
it uses under the hood.

340
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,720
Alright so the next place is going to be Svelte UX.

341
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,520
And this is absolutely a great library.

342
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,160
So we can actually look at it.

343
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,000
Basically this has components for you from app bar, app layout if you want, nav items,

344
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,320
settings and etc.

345
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,640
It has other elements like avatars, button, button group, inputs like checkbox, field

346
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
and etc.

347
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,960
But the most impressive things here to me are probably going to be, let me actually

348
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
see.

349
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,080
You can see you have everything here from state, form, selection, you have motion, scrolling

350
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,360
values, spring values.

351
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,120
So if you want to animate some values let's say you're going to see how we're going to

352
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,300
use spring animations here.

353
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,040
So we're going to animate to 100.

354
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,320
Let's go to -100.

355
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,120
You can see how cool is this.

356
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,640
Ah and this is always that gets me these examples in this library.

357
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Look how cool this is.

358
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,200
So here you have this tilt component.

359
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,840
You can see here we can tilt this but we can improve it even further.

360
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,600
We can set the brightness and we can also add a shine like a foil card or whatever.

361
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,240
This looks really cool to me.

362
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,640
We can actually change the perspective amount.

363
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,160
How cool is this right?

364
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,800
I can always play with these examples all day.

365
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,880
And then of course it has other things so you have a tween value here also so you can just

366
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,700
use a regular tween.

367
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,560
And this is what's also the coolest thing to me.

368
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,960
So this uses this SVG trick to make gooey morphing things using SVG filters I think.

369
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,920
So you can see here we have morphing text.

370
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,440
You can morph whatever you want basically like this and you can have even rounded text

371
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
background.

372
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,960
So you can see how you have this orbiting glowing dot.

373
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,880
It looks like goo because it's using an SVG filter under the hood.

374
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,720
So for example if we look at the code example we can see that it uses this component.

375
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,760
It uses this trick blur and contrast in SVG or it has to use the color matrix tricks because

376
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,440
if you ever played around with contrast and this trick using regular CSS and SVG then

377
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,680
you know that you can only apply to black and white things.

378
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,040
So I think this is using a color matrix or whatever under the hood to make this effect

379
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
work.

380
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,840
But maybe one day we can actually look at how it works exactly.

381
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,200
But yeah you can actually see how cool this looks.

382
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,800
Here you can see here we have a gooey mouse.

383
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,880
You can see how wonderful is that friends.

384
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,280
So in the third place we have rocket which is another cool UI library component.

385
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,960
So you can say get started.

386
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,060
These are composable elements which you can use.

387
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,320
So it differentiates these atoms where you have icons and etc.

388
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,660
So let's see then it has molecules.

389
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,160
Let me find some component.

390
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Yeah let's see.

391
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,640
Yeah now we can see you have these components like this slider and etc.

392
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,480
I wish this was done better on the side because now you have to close all of these things

393
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,320
but it doesn't matter.

394
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,720
You can actually see let's see what are organisms.

395
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,360
So organisms are things like switch, tabs, lists and etc.

396
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,240
Maybe we can read the documentation right to understand what all of these things mean.

397
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,800
But yeah if you need any of these things you can see they're animated, they're custom made.

398
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,600
So this looks really great.

399
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,400
And another cool thing about rocket it uses uno CSS.

400
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,040
I know some of you love uno CSS.

401
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,320
Basically it's a Italian version made by Antfoo which is a really genius developer right.

402
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,480
So he said okay television CSS isn't enough for me I want to make uno CSS which does what

403
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I want right.

404
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,520
And basically a lot of people enjoy uno CSS and it seems to resonate with them.

405
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,480
So try out uno CSS if you haven't.

406
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Alright so in the fourth place this is really interesting Svelte Mini Maps.

407
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,960
These are just useful apps that you can use in your daily life.

408
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,280
Anything this was mostly made for learning purposes if I understand correctly so you can

409
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,360
have advanced emoji tools, English dictionary, contribution tracker and etc.

410
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,880
So for example if you go here to apps you can see you have advanced emoji tools, budget

411
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,920
tracker, currency converter if you need this, markdown editor, contribution tracker for

412
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,800
github, English dictionary, QR code generator, random emoji generator, random password generator

413
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,320
and even a to do list with persistence if that's something that you need.

414
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,000
But yeah I think this is a really cool idea and this is the power of the web because you

415
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,720
can make things for yourself right.

416
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,280
You can just put it on the web you don't have to build some desktop app unless you want

417
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
to right.

418
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,080
We learned about Tori which is really cool you can use Electron whatever but this is

419
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,040
the coolest part about the web you can make something really useful for yourself or others

420
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,640
and you can just host it on the web for free basically almost right like this is just a

421
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
personal site basically.

422
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,320
But yeah this is a really wonderful project.

423
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,420
Alright and the last entry in the list in the fifth place is Rogue Lighter Engine.

424
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,400
And I was most excited about this one because this is a 2D game engine made with Svelte

425
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,120
but unfortunately I couldn't get this thing to run.

426
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,440
I tried on Linux Windows I would just get some build errors it wanted this build tools

427
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,600
then it wanted some other build tools and you know how it goes.

428
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,360
I just couldn't get it to run so maybe if someone can figure it out maybe write it in

429
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,800
the comments or if the author itself is watching maybe write some better instructions in the

430
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,240
repo right how can I run this because just installing dependencies and running it doesn't

431
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,440
work at least for me but I can only pretend how it works because basically this is also

432
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,880
a Tori app so I imagine when you open this app this is like a 2D game engine where you

433
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,000
can maybe have a GUI where you drag things around or I don't know maybe you write code

434
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,760
by hand I'm not sure you have some examples here which is most likely a representation

435
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,080
you can just copy and paste to recreate what you have or made with that engine right so

436
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,320
for example here we have some text this is how you would maybe do text using that GUI

437
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,640
right I can only guess right so for example here we have computed variables as text and

438
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,280
you have a lot of cool examples here so you have a pause menu, functions, settings, FPS

439
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,600
how we can set things so we have this nice character we also have things like movement

440
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,520
and etc so you can just probably copy paste this and then you have this done in the game

441
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
editor.

442
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,320
But yeah basically this looks like a really cool concept I really want to try it out.

443
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,440
But yeah that's basically it if you want to support my work you can become a Patreon

444
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,160
member and you can even join the discord.

445
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,840
Thank you for watching and I'll catch you in the next one.

446
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,360
Peace.
