1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Hey friends, what's up?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,960
If you aren't aware recently the Svel hack 2024 rules edition has ended.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,440
And basically if you're one of the lucky participants in the Svel hackathon, maybe you enjoy some

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,120
of these big money prizes so we can see you could've earned up to $3000 for the first

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,920
place which is really awesome just for writing some Svelte.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,080
And we can even look at some winners from previous years, so 2023 halftime flies right?

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,120
Someone actually made Wolfenstein in the browser, so they basically made Wolfen Svelte which

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,820
is a fully playable port of Wolfenstein 3D, 100% rendered by Svelte.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,520
So no WebGL or Canvas, it just uses CSS and transforms things around and it just slaps

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,940
things in the browser which is really incredible.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,560
Then you also had some awesome and amazing projects which a lot of people love, like

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,120
Superforms for example.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,200
And then you had some other amazing projects like SvelteLab which is basically a repl for

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,240
SvelteKit projects so you can easily spin up Svelte or SvelteKit projects and try things

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,200
out without much fuss, right?

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,240
But today we're going to be looking at the previous year of our Lord, 2024, it's already

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,740
2025, so we're going to look at some cool apps from a cross-platform app launcher like

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,080
Krakas to some fun games made with Svelte.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,200
Alright, so the first category is going to be WizBangery.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
And what is WizBangery?

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,560
Well basically the wizards of WizBangery are masters of innovation, showcasing novel and

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,420
impressive uses of Svelte.

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,080
Basically you make something cool and then you get paid.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,380
And the first place is going to be KunKun.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,380
And what is KunKun?

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,480
KunKun is an open source extensible cross-platform app launcher.

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,560
Basically it's like Krakas but for every other platform, right?

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
So it's cross-platform extensible with a focus on privacy.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,040
So let's actually look at how it looks like.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,320
So you can launch KunKun and of course you can search for applications, maybe there's

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,160
even an extension for searching for files and you have these built-in commands, right,

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,400
which are really useful and you have system-wide commands like cleaning the trash and etc.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,320
And you can of course go to the store, you can install any of these extensions or you

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,560
can create your own extension.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
How cool is this?

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,900
And there's a lot of cool tech behind KunKun.

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,100
So basically it uses Tori.

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,560
If you're familiar with Electron, Tori is like Electron.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,840
By the way, writing pure JavaScript is basically Rust first, but then you can use any front-end

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,220
framework JavaScript that is that you want.

41
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,840
You can use Svelte, React and etc.

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,640
And that's how you can easily build cross-platform applications and in the future even mobile

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
apps, I think.

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,680
And the major difference between Tori and Electron is that Electron ships the entire

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,200
Chrome browser or whatever, but Tori on the other hand uses the built-in web views in

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,380
your operating system.

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,320
So your operating system, Windows, Mac, OS, Linux, etc. have a built-in browser that comes

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,280
with it, right, so it uses that instead.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,000
That's basically how I understand it.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,360
But because Tori is so new, it doesn't really have that entire ecosystem that Electron does.

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,680
And keep in mind Tori isn't this Electron killer that people pretend it is because you're

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,520
going to have to write Rust and etc., which is of course the blazing fast language.

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,040
So if you're into that, then you can use Tori.

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,400
And of course, it uses Svelte for the UI and Tailwind, CSS for the styling, but in particular

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,120
it uses Shad C and Svelte.

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
That's why it looks so good.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,160
And you can of course learn more about KunKun if you go to their docs.

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,480
Here you have get started, how to install it.

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,760
You can go through the demo, here they showcase a lot of these extensions that you have.

60
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,560
So you can just go to the store, you can install the extension, you can have clipboard history,

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
disk speed, file transfer, video converter and etc.

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,560
There's nothing you can do, right?

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,000
You can even write it yourself.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And it has also a huge emphasis on security because you know JavaScript, NPM, Ecosystem,

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,640
you install a package and boom, now you have a Cryptominer.

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Haha, pun.

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,080
Okay, but seriously, it actually tries its best and it's really new so you can even

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,640
join, hop in, help the development, right?

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,480
And it's not just Svelte if you want to write an extension, so let me just actually
